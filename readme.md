## Tanglr

Tanglr is our online solution to the distracting world of social networking and we’re giving control back to our users!  

We combined the technologies we learned at Codeup  and applied discipline to learn new frameworks and design in order to give our users the power,  agility and performance they’ve come to expect from similar sites, but customized our user experience to be bold and assertive. 

There are three ways Tanglr users can interact within Tanglr
Create: 
	Tanglr users can create groups for others to join via public groups or a private group(AKA Knots) and assign password authentication.

Connect:
	Tanglr users can connect with interactive, realtime chats/posts and customize their experience with avatar images and media functionality. 


Unite: 
	A Tanglr user can unite their groups and involve their friends and colleagues for a common cause or with content that is close to their hearts. 

We wanted to offer identity to Tanglr users and easily implemented this feature with a filestack API.  filestack is the #1 developers service for end user content. Doing so allows our users to host images without the heaviness and lag of using our own database. Tanglr can source pics from anywhere on the web tapping the power of 20+  cloud services such as Facebook, Instagram Drop box and google drive to name a few.  Selecting an image has never been easier and you can create powerful, meaningul content.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
